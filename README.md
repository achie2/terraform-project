# terraform-project
my first terraform projects (Creating vpc)
I have craeated  a vpc in eu-west-2 region with two public and private subnets across two azs.
There are 2 route tables connected to their respective subnets.
The public route table has been associated with internet gateway.
Variable.tf has been created to be used as a template for future use.
